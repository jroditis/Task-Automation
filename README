I'll admit, 90% of my difficulty with this assignment was that I confused appscript with actual code because I didn't make a distinction of it in my notes. There's a more detailed record of this in my attached PDF but... Yeah. Not my brightest moment. 
I would like to come back to this concept eventually, maybe for something a little more scalable like heavily customized newsletters (if that is a feasible use).
